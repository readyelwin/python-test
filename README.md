# readyelwin
I made is project about a few things about my life. In the hello file I talk about my interests and my old basketball years from when I was younger.
In the Family tab I talk about my family and how special everyone is to me. In the MySchool tab I wrote about my college and explained how much that school shaped me into who I am now.
In the Dream tab I explain my dream places that I would really want to travel.
