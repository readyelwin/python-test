            One of my dream places to travel is London. It is one of my dream places to travel because it is one of the mecca cities in the world.
            I feel like there are a lot of big things in London and a lot of oppourtunity out there.
            I would not only love to travel there but I also would love to live out there for a while.
            Another reason I would love to travel there is because I want to see all the castles. There is a lot of history there and I love history.
            That would be a very exciting trip for me. Also the clothing brands out there would be great to see as well.

        <p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%";>
            Italy is another place I would love to go because I LOVE Italian food. They have the best food in the world to me.
            So going there and eating authentic Italian food would be a great expirence for me and I would cherish it.
            Since I really enjoy history I would love to see the Colosseum and learn the history of it.
            Italy also has a nice history of outstanding cars that I would love to see.
            They also have some desinger clothing brands that I have to check out too.

            Paris is another place that I have to visit in my life. I love french food and a lot and I like some of the desinger brands based in the city.
            Also seeing the Effiel Tower is a must for me so Paris is definitley a place I have to travel.
