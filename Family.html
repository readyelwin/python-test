                    Mareesha is my oldest sister and I have known her my whole life.
                    She always has looked out for me as all of my family has. We lookout for each other at all times
                    She has a few kids that I love dearly. She also used to play ball back in the day.
                    Now she stays in Washington DC with her family having a good time.

                    My mom is very special to me. She is always there when I need her for anything.
                    She is by far my biggest supporter in anything I do and her support has alot of value to me.
                    I love my mom so much with all of my heart.

                    My dad is very special to me just like how everyone is in my immediate family.
                    He has always pushed me to strive for excellence and I would not change that for the world.
                    I appreciate him alot.
